    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have seen a brief on the recurrent neural networks, how they work and how to deal with sequences using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that RNN are much more efficient in working with sequences because they learn the knowledge embedded in the sequence unlike feed forward network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed how GRU is better than RNN in two main points, the way it handles the memory and also the vanishing gradient handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have seen the LSTM and how it adds more gates to learn more about the sequence and enable a long term memory besides the short term, thus can work with larger sequences.\n",
